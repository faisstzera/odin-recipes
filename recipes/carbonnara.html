                <ol>
                    <li>Put a large saucepan of water on to boil and put the pasta to cook when the water is hot enough.</li>
                    <li>Chop the pancetta and fry it while the pasta cooks</li>
                    <li>Turn off the fire from the pancetta pan after you fry it. Mix the eggs with pecorino and parmesan. You can add how much black pepper you want.</li>
                    <li>Now the pasta is probably cooked. Put some of the pasta water inside a glass recipient to keep it warm and drain the pasta.</li>
                    <li>You need to mix everything fast inside the pancetta pan. The pan can't be hot because you don't want to overcook the eggs. Make sure to add the pasta water to that mix</li>
                    <li>It's done! Enjoy your meal!</li>
